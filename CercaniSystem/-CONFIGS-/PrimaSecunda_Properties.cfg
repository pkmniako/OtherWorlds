			%tidallyLocked = True
			%description = Prima is the biggest planet of this double planet system. It said to be dead, although some black terrain found says it could be an under-surface ocean, with fishes and stuff! (Snaks not). It has big frozen plains where you can race other Kerbals with rocket-powered rovers. Flips and crashes included in races!

	@Body[Secunda]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Companion of Prima as the smaller planet of the double system, it's the most active body known with Crons and Laythe. While most part of the planet is covered in green terrain with craters, the rest is very active forming plains and a giant clover. Cracks are spread in this active area, making it not the best place for races.
